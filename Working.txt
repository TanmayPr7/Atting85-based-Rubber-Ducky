# This is an Atting85 USB Developemnet based Rubber Ducky project, which uses a microcontroller(Attiny85 USB),
push buttons, PCb, 10k resistors, etc. This Rubber Ducky is programmed for four different purposes:
i.Automatic Use
ii.Perosonal Use
iii.4-digit Pin Use
iv.6-digit Pin Use
When Rubber Ducky is connected to any system via USB port,on ducky attiny85 is connected to multiple push buttons,
on pressing one the push button it works according to the source code and enter commands via USB ports into
systems and performs different desiered tasks.

# It basically works by controlling the keyboard action with the help of "DigiKeyboard.h" Library, attiny first reads
the position and state of every push button and works accordingly & when any of the push buttons is pressed by the user,
it inputs commands into the system acoording to the source. After those commands enters the system it controlls the
keyboard commands in the system and perform tasks for which it is programmed, after reciving keyboard commands from
ducky system acts and perform tasks accordingly.


# In this case ducky sends the commands into system via USB port, which later recived by the system and them system
works accordingly and perform the commanded tasks into the system. Ex. If ducky sends
command to open notepad and then wait for 1000ms and type "You are Hacked!", then system will recive this command
via USB port and will perform the tasks acording to commands.

# This the baisc working principle of Attiny85 based Rubber Ducky Project:)
