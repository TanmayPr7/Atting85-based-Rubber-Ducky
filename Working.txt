# This is an Atting85 Rubber Ducky project, which uses a microcontroller(Attiny85 USB), push buttons,
PCb, 10k resistors, etc. This Rubber Ducky is programmed for four different purposes:
i.Automatic Use
ii.Perosonal Use
iii.4-digit Pin Use
iv.6-digit Pin Use
When Rubber Ducky is connected to any system via USB port, either it automatically access and can use
differnet keyboard keys

# It basically works with RF(Rc) signals, Rc transmitter first reads the position of its joystick's
and according to the position of its joysticks it transmittes RF signals, which later recived by Rc
reciver. After, reciving signals from transmitter reciver according to its source code or program
checks the signal and works according to the code and makes the servo or any other part connected
to reciver moves according to source code.

# In this case Rc transmitter transmites values, which later recived by Rc reciver and then reciver
according to its source code make the robotic arm move according to program. Ex. If transmitter sends
signal to make the robotic arm move in forward direction then reciver will recive the signal and make
the robotic arm move in forward direction accoeding to its program.

# This the baisc working principle of Attiny85 based Rubber Ducky Project:)
